# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

**Author**: Patrick Laurion, Keian Anthony

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
### Logistical
#### What hours will you be available to communicate?
- 12-3 PM each day
#### What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- We will primarily communicate by slack.
#### How often will you take breaks?
- We plan on taking breaks roughly every hour or whenever someone needs to do something. We understand that both the authors of this project have lives and need to step away to do things in real life once in a while.
#### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- If we don't accomplish desired results in aloted time, we will arrange more time for the goals of the day later on in the day.
### Cooperative
#### Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
- Keian: Listener, Communicator, Available, Friendly :)
- Patrick: Effectively communicate, Determination
#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
- Being able to communicate helps both people be able to understand the "why" as well as the ability to get together to work on a problem or tackle a goal more conveniently to both parties involved.
#### In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Keian: I want to work on the backend more, so I will drive the back end more.
- Patrick: I would like to strengthen my knowledge on the front end.
#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
- Talk though each step and make sure both people understand the idea behind it.
### Conflict Resolution
#### What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
- The person pulling the weight will directly address the other about not participating enough.
#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
- Directly addressing the other person that they wish to contribute more.
#### How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- The more "advanced" person shouldn't feel the need to take over when they see the other struggling, instead they can give the person struggling a nudge in the right direction.
